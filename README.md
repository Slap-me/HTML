# Tools
This is a project created by a junior high school student to collect and organize some of the short but surprisingly useful programming source code and cybersecurity tools he found

-Today I uploaded some collected source code, 
-warning! These codes have fatal and funny logic errors, please don't use them directly, I would appreciate it if you could help me fix them, thank you!
File that contains errors:按下按钮.jsx;点击多次触发不同事件循环.html;秒表.html;MyFirstHTML.html
